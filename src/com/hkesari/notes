platform independence vs machine independence

Is java machine independent or platform independent?                       --Both, same bytecode runs on all machines/ OS in jvm.

Is JVM platform independent or machine independent?                        -- JVM is platform dependent.

Is java compiled or interpreted?                                          --in between. Just in time compilation happens.

What is just in time compilation?                                        --java code is converted into bytecode which is platform independent.

What is bytecode?                                                        --intermediate code after compilation.
                                                                          --platform independent representation of program
                                                                         --if doesn't depend on any os, hardware etc.

Does java compile to native code like C++?                                --No, it is converted to bytecode which is interpreted by jit compiler inside jvm.

Advantages of JIT compilation.                                            --source code is platform independent.
                                                                          -- faster than pure interpretation
                                                                          --caching of byte code happens.

Commands to compile java program                                          --javac Hello.java, java Hello


Difference bw jre, jdk and jvm and their roles.                                 --jdk - for dev, jre - for running, jvm - for execution. jvm lies in jre, jre lies in jdk.

equals vs == in java                                                              -- equals compares content of object while == compares references

Static, Final, Finally, Finalize?

static - that which doesn't belong to object but is associated with class. can be accessed without object creation.
final field =   can't be changed
final method =  can't be overridden
final class =   not inheritable
Finally  = used with try and catch as the final step.
Finalize = method called before gc cleans.


When does finally execute in try - catch ?                                   - always unless there is some system crash or deliberate termination.


Entry point of java program ?

this vs super in java                                                             this - associated with present object, super - superclass


throw vs throws                                                                  -- throws is used in method definition to indicate that this method throws exception while throw is used to manually throw exception.

Types of access modifier : public, private , default

Types of constructors                                                                      -- default, copy, parameterized

Can top level class be private or protected?                                                --  No, since it is useless then. No one can utilize that class.

Why main method is static ?                                                                --so that jvm can call it without creating instance of that class.

Can static methods be overloaded/ overridden?
                                                                                          --only overloaded. no overrides since static methods have static binding.
                                                                                            they are associated with class, not an instance and hence no runtime polymorphism

Can top level class be static?                                                         --By design, in java you can't add static to top level class. A non-static class can't exist without a static class. So, top level classes are always static.

are static variables inherited?                                                             -- Static variables are SHARED(not inherited) with all subclasses.

Is java purely oop?                                                                     -- no, because it still has primitive data types.

Pillars of OOPs -                                                                      --abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism

Types of inheritance in java. explain them. Implement them.                                      --single, multilevel, hierarchical (through classes)
                                                                                                  --multiple, hybrid (through interface)

marker interface & examples                                 serializable, cloneable

can interface have variables ?                                                                 yes. they are static and final by default.

What is heap?                                                                      -- memory allocated to program. dynamic in size.

heap vs stack memory?                                                              --stack contains local and primitive values and references to objects.
                                                                                   --heap contains objects in java.

Heaps vs stack?  Compare their size, memory management, safety etc.                                  --stack is contiguous and safe. needs no memory management.
                                                                                            heaps need memory to be allocated and deallocated, but in java gc does that.
                                                                                             heaps are not contiguous.

See the collection framework architecture

When to use which collection
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21974361/which-java-collection-should-i-use

Why use List<T> = new ArrayList rather than ArrayList<T> = new ArrayList()?


Comparable vs Comparator in java.

Collection vs Collections in java                                     --both are in java.util package. Collection is an interface. Collection framework has many interfaces - set,map,etc
                                                                        collections is a class containing utility methods - reverse(),sort()


Array vs collection                                                      -- static vs dynamic size,homo vs hetro objects, ready made methods

advantage of collection framework                                         -- consistent API. since they all implement the same core methods, readability
                                                                         --avoiding reinventing the wheel


Vector vs arrayList                                                    -- vector is sync (thread safe). arrayList is not & thus faster.

Can we add null in TreeSet                                              -- no it will throw null pointer exception

Iterator vs ListIterator                                            --Iterator traverses in forward direction only, listIterator in both directions
                                                                    --ListIterator is used with lists only and it can return index as well as modify collection

HashMap vs Hashtable                                                      --hashtable is thread safe & doesn't allow any null values .

how hashmap works internally?

hashmap vs linkedHashmap vs treemap
           --hashmap - no ordering, uses hashtable,
           --linkedHashmap - insertion order maintained, uses double linked buckets
           --treemap - natural ordering or according to comparator, uses red black tree. insertion time log n
