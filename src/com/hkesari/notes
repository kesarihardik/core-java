Is java compiled or interpreted?                                          --in between. Just in time compilation happens.

What is just in time compilation?                                        --java code is converted into bytecode which is platform independent.

What is bytecode?                                                        --intermediate code after compilation.
                                                                          --platform independent representation of program
                                                                         --if doesn't depend on any os, hardware etc.

Does java compile to native code like C++?                                --No, it is converted to bytecode which is interpreted by jit compiler inside jvm.

Advantages of JIT compilation.                                            --source code is platform independent.
                                                                          -- faster than pure interpretation
                                                                          --caching of byte code happens.

Commands to compile java program                                          --javac Hello.java, java Hello

Is java machine independent or platform independent?                       --Both, same bytecode runs on all machines/ OS in jvm.


Difference bw jre, jdk and jvm and their roles.                                 --jdk - for dev, jre - for running, jvm - for execution. jvm lies in jre, jre lies in jdk.

equals vs == in java                                                              -- equals compares content of object while == compares references

Static, Final, Finally, Finalize?

static - that which doesn't belong to object but is associated with class. can be accessed without object creation.
final field =   can't be changed
final method =  can't be overridden
final class =   not inheritable
Finally  = used with try and catch as the final step.
Finalize = method called before gc cleans.


When does finally execute in try - catch ?                                     - - always unless there is some system crash or deliberate termination.


Entry point of java program ?

this vs super in java                                                                     this - associated with present object, super - superclass


throw vs throws                                                                  -- throws is used in method definition to indicate that this method throws exception while throw is used to manually throw exception.

Types of access modifier : public, private , default

Types of constructors                                                                      -- default, copy, parameterized

Can top level class be private or protected?                                                --  No, since it is useless then. No one can utilize that class.

Why main method is static ?                                                                --so that jvm can call it without creating instance of that class.

Can static methods be overloaded/ overridden?                                   --only overloaded. no overrides since static methods are loaded at runtime and hence no runtime polymorphism

Can top level class be static?                                                         --By design, in java you can't add static to top level class. A non-static class can't exist without a static class. So, top level classes are always static.

are static variables inherited?                                                             -- Static variables are SHARED(not inherited) with all subclasses.

keywords for inheritance and interface implementation                                   --extends, implements

Types of inheritance in java. explain them. Implement them.                                      --single, multilevel, hierarchical (through classes)

Interface vs Abstract classes                                                               --interface is a contract that has to be implemented by class implementing it. interface can't have any definition of methods. just declaration of methods.
                                                                                           --abstract class is a class that has at least one abstract method. method without definition.


can interface have variables ?                                                                 yes. they are static and final by default.

What is string immutability in java?                                              --string contents can't be changed once a string is created in string pool.
                                                                                  -- if you change contents of string, a new string is created.


Why string immutability ?                                                              --String operations and storage is costly. security reasons. can't change string

How long a string resides in string pool ?                                          --until there are no references to it. Then gc comes and cleans it.s

Where is string pool ?                                                              -- in heap.

string str = "ABC"  VS  String str = new String("ABC") diff ? where these two string will take space in memory?
    https://www.scaler.com/topics/java/string-pool-in-j

What is heap?                                                                      -- memory allocated to program. dynamic in size.

heap vs stack memory?                                                              --stack contains local and primitive values and references to objects.

See the collection framework architecture

When to use which collection
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21974361/which-java-collection-should-i-use

Why use List<T> = new ArrayList rather than ArrayList<T> = new ArrayList()?


Comparable vs Comparator in java.

Collection vs Collections in java                                       -- collection is an interface , collections is a class

Array vs collection                                                      -- static vs dynamic size,homo vs hetro objects, ready made methods

advantage of collection framework                                         -- consistent API. since they all implement the same core methods, readability
                                                                         --avoiding reinventing the wheel

advantages of generics                                               -- type safe, no type casting needed

Do collections work with primitive data types                            --No,they work with objects only but autoboxing and unboxing takes care of it.


Vector vs arrayList                                                    -- vector is sync (thread safe). arrayList is not & thus faster.

Can we add null in TreeSet                                              -- no it will throw null pointer exception

Iterator vs ListIterator                                            --Iterator traverses in forward direction only, listIterator in both directions
                                                                    --ListIterator is used with lists only and it can return index as well as modify collection

List vs Set                                                            --set only has unique values

Hashset vs HashMap                                                    -- diff parent interfaces.

HashMap vs Hashtable                                                      --hashtable is thread safe & doesn't allow any null values .

how hashmap works internally?


hashmap vs linkedHashmap vs treemap
           --hashmap - no ordering, uses hashtable,
           --linkedHashmap - insertion order maintained, uses double linked buckets
           --treemap - natural ordering or according to comparator, uses red black tree. insertion time log n

                             -- open closed principle (open for extension, closed for modification)
                             --liskov substitution - superclass obj should be replaceable by subclass obj.

                             -- Dependency inversion -- we should depend on interface, abstraction. Details should depend on abstraction, not vice versa.
