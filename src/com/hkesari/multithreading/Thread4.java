//Thread safe means its value can be accessed by multiple threads at the same time without any problem. it is never cached.

//Volatile vs synchronized       volatile is used with variables, sync is used with methods & blocks. volatile is nob-blocking , sync blocks. Hence, volatile has no deadlock or livelock problems
//volatile -                     no thread creates local copy. read and write operations on main memory only.
//synchronized  -                 only one thread gets access to the block. thread get update of value from main memory and flush it to main after done with it before exit.
//atomic                       - -similar to volatile but higher performance.
// don't use synchronized and volatile together
