Exception :  unexpected/unwarranted error or event while runtime that disrupts the normal flow of program

error vs exception
        - both belong to throwable class in java.
        - errors belong to Error class, exception belong to Exception class.
        - errors are beyond the scope of program. They can't be recovered from. e.g - OutOfMemoryError
        - we handle exception. errors are beyond application scope.
        - errors are always of unchecked types. exceptions are of checked and unchecked types.

exception types :  built in, user defined
                  built in has 2 types
                         - checked/ compile time(interrupted exception, class not found, file not found, sql)
                         - unchecked / runtime (null pointer, arithmetic,array out of bound)

                         -user defined is always runtime exception.
